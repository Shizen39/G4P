# G4P
### Gym Grammar Guided Genetic Programming


G4P, written in python, solves [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) Reinforcement Learning problems through the use of grammar guided genetic programming.

G4P is developed in a parametric and modular way with respect to the information provided by the different Gym environments, so most of them can be used as a starting input to evolve their agents.

Chromosomes that evolve with G4P are python programs, which will act as actors that will solve the Gym environment in use.
